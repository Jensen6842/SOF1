# Software 1: Foundations of Programming for Computer Science

## Description
Students will be introduced to different programming constructs, basic data structures, command line tools, integrated development environments and unit testing of programs. <br />
Students will learn how to describe well-defined tasks using pseudocode and translate them into programs using a procedural programming paradigm. <br />
